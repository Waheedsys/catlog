## Overview

Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic algorithm that allows a secret to be divided into multiple parts, where only a certain number of parts are required to reconstruct the original secret. This repository includes both the implementation of the algorithm and a manual checking process for validating the outputs.
